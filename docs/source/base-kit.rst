Revision 01
-----------

**Memory**: every time the microcontroller is programmed, the memory remains until it is reprogrammed or the reset button is pressed. As we don’t want the line following or obstacle detecting function to run straight after it is powered, a power on/off button will be implemented on the controller.

**Power supply**: Two Li-ion 18650 is used to power the robot
A 9V battery was tested for use as it is cheaper but we haven’t been successful in getting a rechargeable 9V battery that is functional
While it is being programmed, the computer supplies the microcontroller
The li-ion batteries are USB rechargeable

**Remote control**: The user can control the robot wirelessly from the remote controller through a radio module. As we want the user to have as many interactions with the electronics of the kit, a physical controller was decided upon instead of an app. 

**Open-source**: A user can modify any portion of the code 
In the future will provide 3 different difficulties of programming; easy, medium and hard
Easy will provide comments in the code for the user to see how the code works. The user will have to write a very minimum or no code
Medium, there will be commented out sections with instructions for the user to fill in with their own code
Hard, No to very little code will be provided and the user will have to code the functionality from scratch.

**Documentation**: A physical manual will be provided to the user, the manual will also be made available digitally on the CreateBase website
Documentation will provide:
Current applications in industry
Describe what is line following, obstacle avoiding and remote controlling
Describe how it works: the functionality of infrared sensors, ultrasonic sensors and radio modules
